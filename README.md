so I got tired of the save file organizer not running properly with the linux environment created by using cheatengine/ERTool with linux and 
how it forces the game to create entirely new directories that SpeedSouls for some reason doesn't see and thus cant properly make savestates for.
things you should do before running my program.
    make the game create a savestate,
      the way to do this is just have the game open go into inventory "leave" an item (any item) on the ground and pick it up. Done. 
      immediately run the script via command-line from the downloads folder. (it will create a home directory to run out of from then on)
          if you havent run anything in command line before now, simply find it in y our file explorer in the downloads folder, then right-click and select "run in terminal"
      ensure that the savestate was created while using any amount of cheats/other nosense that doesn't come with the game so that it is going to run in the same environment
      once it has been run for the first time, you should be fine, and it should run smoothly from here on in. if anything messes up you can always just copy all the files
      (that you named if you followed the on-screen prompts) into a folder on your desktop, delete the entire savestateFolder from your home directory, and run it again from the downloads folder,
      then drag and drop the files you put in the desktop folder back into the same place you found them iniitally. This will fix like 90% of the issues you could have, or hit me up here, but no promises
      on speedy replies, im new to using github to actually contribute if it wasn't obvious by this readme. Enjoy and happy practicing, I hope this makes someone's life switching to linux easier.
